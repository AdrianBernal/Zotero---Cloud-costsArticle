%Describe the practical problem addressed, its significance and its causes
Research has shown that a major problem within Sell cloud computing services is that Misplanned cloud infrastructures and price models... \cite{Calheiros2011}. This problem is of particular concern as it is now well established that it can lead to improvable pricing models \cite{DevelopingUser} \cite{DevelopingUser}, improvable cloud infrastructures and Poorly predicted workloads \cite{Chi2017}. Causes can be diverse: (1) Difficulty, risk and high cost of changes in the deployed infrastructure... \cite{Calheiros2011} \cite{Calheiros2011} \cite{Chi2017}, (2) heterogeneous and varying user requeriments and demands \cite{Calheiros2011} \cite{Calheiros2011} and (3) it is tedious to reconfigure benchmarking parameters \cite{Calheiros2011}.
